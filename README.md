# 0x12. JavaScript - Warm up
> JavaScript

Within this project directory, JavaScript serves multiple purposes. Specifically, these projects will employ JavaScript for two primary reasons:

1. Scripting, akin to the approach used with Python.
2. Web front-end development.
# 0x13. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

My learning will explore the intricacies of JavaScript, focusing on Objects, Scopes, and Closures. This will allow me to dive into the core concepts of object-oriented programming, understand the nuances of variable scopes, and master the art of closures. This repository serves as a comprehensive guide, providing hands-on exercises and in-depth explanations to enhance my proficiency in these critical JavaScript topics.

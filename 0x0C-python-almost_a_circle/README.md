# 0x0C. Python - Almost a circle
> Python OOP

## Background Context
> The AirBnB project is a big part of the Higher level curriculum. This project will help you be ready for it.
> In this project, I used everything about Python:
> - Import
> - Exceptions
> - Class
> - Private attribute
> - Getter/Setter
> - Class method
> - Static method
> - Inheritance
> - Unittest
> - Read/Write file
> - args and kwargs
> - Serialization/Deserialization
> - JSON

## Tasks
1. Base class
> Class Base:
> private class attribute ```__nb_objects = 0```
> class constructor: ```def __init__(self, id=None):```


2. First Rectangle
> Write the class Rectangle that inherits from Base:
> In the file models/rectangle.py
> Class Rectangle inherits from Base
> Private instance attributes, each with its own public getter and setter:
> __width -> width
> __height -> height
> __x -> x
> __y -> y
> Class constructor: ```def __init__(self, width, height, x=0, y=0, id=None):```


10. And now, the Square!
> Write the class Square that inherits from Rectangle:
> In the file models/square.py
> Class Square inherits from Rectangle
> Class constructor: ``def __init__(self, size, x=0, y=0, id=None):```

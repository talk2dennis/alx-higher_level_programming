# Tasks

0. Print a list of integers
- Write a function that prints all integers of a list.
- Prototype: def print_list_integer(my_list=[]):
- Format: one integer per line. See example

1. Secure access to an element in a list
- Prototype: def element_at(my_list, idx):
- If idx is negative, the function should return None
- If idx is out of range (> of number of element in my_list), the function should return None

2. Replace element
- Prototype: def replace_in_list(my_list, idx, element):
- If idx is negative, the function should not modify anything, and returns the original list
- If idx is out of range (> of number of element in my_list), the function should not modify anything, and returns the original list

3. Print a list of integers... in reverse!
- Write a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.
- Prototype: def print_reversed_list_integer(my_list=[]):
- Format: one integer per line. See example

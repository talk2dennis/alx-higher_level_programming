# 0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping

This project repository showcases a Python application developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The project integrates seamlessly with MySQL databases through SQL queries and employs an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework, specifically SQLAlchemy, to simplify database interactions. With a focus on robustness, efficiency, and maintainability, this project leverages Python's powerful OOP capabilities to build a scalable solution that seamlessly integrates with SQL databases.

## The tasks in this repo will explore the above.
